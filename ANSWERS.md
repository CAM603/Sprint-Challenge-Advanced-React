- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

If hooks were not a thing, I would use class components anytime I wanted to use state and/or lifecycle methods.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

componentDidMount: Invoked after a component is mounted. 

componentDidUpdate: Invoked after updating but not after the initial render 

componentWillUnmount: Invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. Clean up anything that was created in componentDidMount.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

Custom hooks allow us to extract component logic into reusable functions and keeps our code DRY.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

Testing allows us to find bugs in code much faster, makes developers write more testable and better code
